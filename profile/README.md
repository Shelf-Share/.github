# Welcome to Shelf Share!

Hi! **Shelf Share** is an online platform aimed at facilitating individuals who want to donate books they no longer need or wish to share with others in need. This site provides various features to streamline the donation process, such as data entry forms, a list of available books for donation along with brief descriptions, and guidance on shipping or book pickup methods. Additionally, book donation websites typically offer information about organizations or communities that will receive the donations, enabling users to ensure that their donated books reach those in need. Sometimes, these sites also provide reports or updates on the positive impact of the book donations made, to show appreciation to donors and encourage further participation.
